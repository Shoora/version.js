Version.js
==========

Test a different script version with the switch of a query string.

Version.js is handy in a number of browser-based, JavaScript testing scenarios:

*   Running **automated tests** of your library or plugin against different
    versions of a dependency? (Think of a jQuery plugin being tested against
    different versions of jQuery to ensure compatibility.) Rolling your own code
    to switch the version? Or worse, creating different test runners for each
    version?

        http://local.dev/test/runner_jquery_150.html
        http://local.dev/test/runner_jquery_161.html
        http://local.dev/test/runner_jquery_180.html

    Use Version.js and simplify your setup to a single test runner:

        http://local.dev/test/runner.html?versionjs=1.5.0
        http://local.dev/test/runner.html?versionjs=1.6.1
        http://local.dev/test/runner.html?versionjs=1.8.0

*   Upgrading to a **new version** of a library or plugin? Use Version.js and
    quickly toggle between versions without touching your code. Very helpful for
    comparing that everything works the same.

*   Tired of **maintaining different versions** of a script you're testing
    against? Have a directory filled with every version of jQuery? Version.js
    has built-in support for the most common CDNs, so you have instant access to
    every library and version available.

Download
--------

### Bower

[Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower) is a package manager for the web. Once
installed, Bower can install Version.js with a single command:

    bower install version.js

### Manually

*   (Minified)[https://raw.github.com/jstayton/version.js/master/build/version.min.js]
*   (Unminified)[https://raw.github.com/jstayton/version.js/master/build/version.js]

Usage
-----

Version.js is included and configured in a single line of code:

    <script src="version.js" data-url="google" data-lib="jquery" data-ver="1.5.0"></script>

The version of the script can then be changed through the `versionjs` query
string parameter:

    http://local.dev/users?versionjs=1.6.1
    http://local.dev/users?versionjs=1.8.0
    http://local.dev/users?versionjs=1.9.1

There's no `version` object or API to call. As soon as Version.js is loaded, it
parses the `data` attributes and loads the specified script in blocking fashion.

To illustrate this, say you're currently loading jQuery 1.7.2 from Google's CDN:

    <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>

This same script can be loaded by Version.js by replacing the above with the
following:

    <script src="version.js" data-url="google" data-lib="jquery" data-ver="1.7.2"></script>

As before, jQuery 1.7.2 will be included and ready for use, but with the
added convenience that Version.js brings.

### Options

All options are specified as `data` attributes on the `<script>` tag that
includes Version.js. `data-url` is the only required option.

*   **data-url**

    The relative or full URL pattern to the script. The name of a CDN can also
    be used for convenience â€” see the list of supported CDNs below.

    A number of placeholders are available, which Version.js then replaces with
    the specified `data` attribute values:

    *   *{{LIBRARY}}*
    *   *{{VERSION}}*
    *   *{{FILE}}*

    For example, the Google CDN URL can be expressed as:

        //ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/{{LIBRARY}}/{{VERSION}}/{{FILE}}.js

    Relative, local URLs can be used just as well:

        /assets/js/jquery-{{VERSION}}.min.js
        /lib/{{LIBRARY}}/{{FILE}}-{{VERSION}}.js

*   **data-lib**

    The name of the library. Replaces the `{{LIBRARY}}` placeholder in the URL.

*   **data-ver**

    The default version to load when no `versionjs` query string parameter is
    specified. Replaces the `{{VERSION}}` placeholder in the URL.

*   **data-file**

    The file name of the script. If unspecified, the name of the library is
    used. Replaces the `{{FILE}}` placeholder in the URL.

### CDNs

For convenience, Version.js has built-in support for a number of common CDNs.
These identifiers can be used in place of a URL:

*   [cdnjs](http://cdnjs.com)
*   [google](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/)
*   [jsdelivr](http://www.jsdelivr.com)

To illustrate, instead of using the full Google CDN URL:

    data-url="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/{{LIBRARY}}/{{VERSION}}/{{FILE}}.js"

The identifier can be used in its place:

    data-url="google"
